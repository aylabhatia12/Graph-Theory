Graph Algorithms &amp; Data Structures


"This repository includes Java implementation of various graph algorithms and data structures, designed for exploration and manipulation of graphs. 
It implements two primary graph representations: adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. The code includes methods to add and remove edges and vertices, as well as to retrieve neighbors, methods to calculate diameter, weak components and reachability. 
It also includes basic algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), enabling users to traverse and analyze graph structures efficiently, alon gwith algorithms for finding cycles in a graph and performing topological sorting, which is essential for scheduling tasks represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
